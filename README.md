# CodeClause-Blindness_Detection

# Blindness Detection Golden Project 
Welcome to the Blindness Detection Golden Project repository! This remarkable project, developed during my Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodeClause, represents a pivotal achievement in the intersection of AI and healthcare. Utilizing advanced techniques and ResNet models, this project aims to pioneer groundbreaking solutions in the early detection of blindness.

# Project Highlights
ResNet50 and ResNet18 Integration
The core strength of this project lies in harnessing the power of ResNet50 and ResNet18 models. ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network, excels at decoding intricate patterns within images. By complementing it with the ResNet18 model, we establish a robust and comprehensive blindness detection system.

# CodeClause's Guiding Impact
The Golden Project emerged under the mentorship of CodeClause during my AI internship. This invaluable experience provided not only a platform to apply theoretical knowledge but also the mentorship and guidance to navigate the complexities of AI in real-world applications.
